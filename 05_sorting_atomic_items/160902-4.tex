State and prove the lower bound for sorting $n$ items in a disk-memory system.

\solution

In the RAM model, we can estimate the lower bound for a \emph{comparison-based}
sorting algorithm by finding the depth of the shallowest comparison-tree, i.e.,
the tree that has a node for each comparison between 2 items of the same input
(every node has fan-out 2). An algorithm correspond to a family of such trees
(one for every input). For a given input of size $n$, the algorithm must search
the best root-to-leaf paths among $n!$ possible permutations. The shallowest
tree that has $n!$ leafs has depth $\log_2 n! \approx \log_2 n^n = n\log_2 n$
(by Stirling's approximation). This formula provides the minimal number of
comparisons that an algorithm must compute to sort the input, while to find the
number of I/Os we have to take in account that many of these comparison may
happen in internal memory (for free). To estimate the number of I/Os we can
therefore model another comparison-tree, such that every node has the fan out as
the number of comparisons that can be done in internal memory, i.e. the number
of possible way in which we can distribute $B$ elements of an I/O among the $M -
B$ already present in memory, which is at most ${M}\choose{B}$, times the number
of possible permutations of the $B$ elements in the I/O block, therefore ${M
\choose B} B!$. Considering the permutations is necessary for the first
$\frac{n}{B}$ I/Os, since the items are unsorted, while for the remaining I/Os
the items are already processed, so the fan-out will be just $M \choose B$.
Therefore every tree that has depth $t$ has ${M \choose B}^t (B!)^\frac{n}{B}$
leaves. By imposing this number to be at least $n!$, we get the final lower bound
%
\begin{align*}
  && && && && &&             && {M \choose B}^t (B!)^\frac{n}{B} &\ge n! && && && && && && && \\
  && && && && && \equiv      && t\log{{M \choose B}} + \frac{n}{B}\log{B!} &\ge \log{n!} && && && && && && && \\
  && && && && && \Rightarrow && tB\log{\frac{M}{B}} + n\log{B} &\ge n\log{n} && && && && && && && \\
  && && && && && \equiv      && tB\log{\frac{M}{B}} &\ge n\log{\frac{n}{B}} && && && && && && && \\
  && && && && && \equiv      && t &\ge \frac{n}{B}\log_{\frac{M}{B}}{\frac{n}{B}}\ . && && && && && && && 
\end{align*}
%
Notice that we can write this lower bound also as $O\big(\frac{n}{B}
\log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{n}{M}\big)$, since
%
\begin{align*}
  \log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{n}{B} =
  \log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{nM}{BM} = \log_{\frac{M}{B}} \frac{n}{M} + 1\ .
\end{align*}
